# 4UE Muon Detection

This repository contains the tools used as part of the 2024 4UE+ collaborative research project on cosmic muon detection. The project relies data collected by teams in Milan, Paris, and Prague using stacks of scintillators. 

The main tool is used to find coincidences between detection events in different data sets based on a given granularity which is determined to be optimal for the detection of cosmic muons emminating from the same atmospheric event.
